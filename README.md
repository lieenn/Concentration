# Concentration Game
Welcome to the Concentration! This Java-based project implements a classic memory-matching card game. 
The objective is to match pairs of cards in the shortest time and with the fewest moves possible.

Rules:
- The game starts with a grid of face-down cards.
- Each turn, the player can choose two cards to flip face-up.
- If the two cards have the same rank and suit, they remain face-up, and the player scores a point.
- If the cards do not match, they are flipped face-down again.
- The game ends when all pairs have been successfully matched.
- The player's score is based on the number of moves made, with fewer moves resulting in a higher score.
- The player can restart the game at any time by pressing the 'r' key.

Have fun and test your memory skills!
